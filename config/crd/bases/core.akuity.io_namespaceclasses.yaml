                  We can pre-create each resource in a reference namespace and just have ObjectRef's

                  This may make sense if the objects we're dealing with are simple *Template* CRDs.
                  Similar to how CAPI uses template references. But then we'd need <XXX>Template CRDs
                  but since the guideline is *any* resource - which may include daemonsets, RBAC, PVCs,
                  or ever other CRs, we don't want to create these actual resources(they consume phys resources)
